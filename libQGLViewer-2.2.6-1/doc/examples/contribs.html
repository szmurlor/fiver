<h1>The contribution examples</h1>

The following examples do not directly illustrate a functionality of the library. Some are very
simple while others are much more involved. Feel free to browse the files and to cut and paste. Only
a short description is here given, the different source code are available in the
<code>examples/contribs</code> directory.

<a name="3dsViewer"></a>
<h2>3dsViewer</h2>
<table>
<tr>
  <td><img src="../images/3dsViewer.jpg" width="330" height="228" alt="3dsViewer"/></td>
<td>
<p>
 The LGPL lib3ds library is used to load and display a 3ds scene.
</p>
<p>
 You need to install the lib3ds library (version 1.2) in order to compile this file.
 See <a href="http://lib3ds.sourceforge.net/">http://lib3ds.sourceforge.net/</a>.
</p>
<p>
 The current version (Version 1.2, Dec 2002) of the lib3ds library is flawed and results in :
 <pre>3dsViewer.cpp:62: `lib3ds_file_bounding_box' undeclared (first use this function)</pre>
</p>
<p>
 A patched version is available on the <a href="../installUnix.html">Unix installation page</a>.
 You can alternately add this line in the file that uses <code>lib3ds_file_bounding_box()</code>
 (or in <code>lib3ds/file.h</code>) :
 <pre>extern "C" { LIB3DSAPI void lib3ds_file_bounding_box(Lib3dsFile *file, Lib3dsVector min, Lib3dsVector max); }</pre>
</p>
<p>
 This example is simply a translation of a lib3ds example. Although is uses display lists, the
 rendering speed does not seem to be as good as with other 3ds libraries (10 factor speed up). Note
 however that this is due to the lib3ds library and not QGLViewer.

<p>
 Implementation of the game of <i>Agora</i>.
</p>
<p>
 <i>Agora</i> is a strategy game for two players. The code is rather complex and
 can be divided in two parts : a QGLViewer implementation for the viewer and an artificial
 intelligence that allows you to play against the computer.
</p>
<p>
 You should find the rules of the game on the web. Questions relative to the artificial
 intelligence implementation should be asked to <code>Jean-Guillaume dot Dumas at imag dot fr</code>.

<h2>anaglyph</h2>
<table>

  <td><img src="../images/anaglyph.jpg" width="330" height="228" alt="anaglyph"/></td>
<td>
<p>
 Displays a scene in pseudo-stereo using anaglyph.
</p>
<p>
 The anaglyph stereo mode displays simultaneously two colored views of the scene. You need to wear
 glasses with colored lenses (here red and blue) to view the stereo image. Each eye then sees the
 associated view, creating the stereo illusion.
</p>
<p>
 All that is needed is to use the <code>loadModelViewMatrixStereo()</code> and
 <code>loadProjectionMatrixStereo()</code> camera functions to set appropriate
 <code>GL_MODELVIEW</code> and <code>GL_PROJECTION</code> matrices.
</p>

<table>
<tr>
  <td><img src="../images/backgroundImage.jpg" width="330" height="228" alt="backgroundImage"/></td>
<td>
<p>
 Displays a background image in the viewer.
</p>
<p>
 This example is derived from the <a href="#textureViewer">textureViewer</a> example. It displays a
 background image in the viewer using a texture. The texture is simply mapped to a quad, drawn before
 the rest of the scene. The depth buffer is flushed after the drawing.
 <code>startScreenCoordinatesSystem()</code> enables an easy pixel coordinate placement of the
 quad.
</p>
<p>
 This example was created by Sylvain Paris. Thanks to him.

  <td><img src="../images/blobWar.jpg" width="330" height="228" alt="blobWar"/></td>
<td>
<p>
 Implementation of the game of <i>BlobWar</i>.
</p>
<p>
 <i>BlobWar</i> is a strategy game for two players. The rules are available in the help menu. The
 two players can be human or computer.
</p>
<p>
 Computer player programs are expected to take two parameters: a board file name and an allowed
 time (which sign determines which player is to play). The output should be the x,y coordinates of
 the start and end positions of the move to play.
</p>
<p>
 A naive greedy program is provided. Compile it using the <code>greedy.pro</code> file (type
 <code>qmake greedy.pro ; make</code> on Unix architectures).

<p>
 Implementation of the game of <i>Dvonn</i>.
</p>
<p>
 <i>Dvonn</i> is a very good strategy game for two players. See the Help menu for complete rules.
 Consider buying the game if you liked it. It is quite cheap and really nicer than this version.
</p>
<p>
 See the <a href="http://www.gipf.com/dvonn/index.html">GIPF project web page</a> for details.

<p>
 Records a scenario that can be replayed and converted into a movie.
</p>
<p>
 An <code>EventRecorder</code> is associated to a <code>QGLViewer</code>. When the
 <code>EventRecorder</code> <code>isRecording()</code>, the different events that are sent to the
 qglviewer() are recorded in an internal data structure. The EventRecorder then can replay these
 events with an identical timing in order to reproduce the recorded scenario. Snapshots can
 optionally be captured during playback, and the resulting image series can be converted into a
 movie.

 This example was created by Serigne Sow and Joerg Liebelt. It features a textured quadtrees
 fractal terrain, which resolution is dynamically updated depending on the camera position.

<p>
 Loads an image file and texture maps a polygon with it.
</p>
<p>
 Pedagogical example that shows how to apply a texture on a 3D object.
 Inspired from the Qt texture example.
</p>
<p>
 The Qt <code>QImage</code> class and its <code>convertToGLFormat()</code> function are used to
 load any image format. The image is included in a larger image whose dimensions are powers of two.
 This is not required if your hardware supports the GL_TEXTURE_RECTANGLE extension. Feel free to
 cut and paste.

<p>
 Displays an alternative 3D view in a corner thumbnail.
</p>
<p>
 This example shows how a thumbnail can be inserted in a corner of the viewer to display an
 alternative display. This can be useful for data structure inspection, different rendering (as
 illustrated here) or debugging. It uses <code>glViewport</code> and <code>glScissor</code> to
 restrict the drawing area.

 This example was created by Sylvain Paris.
