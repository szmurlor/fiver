1. Introduction

UFC (Unified Form-assembly Code) is a unified framework for finite
element assembly. More precisely, it defines a fixed interface for
communicating low level routines (functions) for evaluating and
assembling finite element variational forms. The UFC interface
consists of a single header file ufc.h that specifies a C++ interface
that must be implemented by code that complies with the UFC
specification. Examples of form compilers that support the UFC
interface are FFC and SyFi. For more information, visit the FEniCS web
page at

    http://www.fenicsproject.org

or refer to the UFC Specification and User Manual in

    doc/manual/ufc-user-manual.pdf

in this source tree.

2. Installation

To install UFC, run

    cmake .
    make
    make install

This installs the header file ufc.h and a small set of Python utilities
(templates) for generating UFC code. Files will be installed under the default
prefix.

The installation prefix may be optionally specified, for example

    cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/local .
    make install

Alternatively, just copy the single header file src/ufc/ufc.h
into a suitable include directory.

If you do not want to build and install the python extenstion module of UFC,
needed by, e.g., PyDOLFIN, you can write

    cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=~/local -D UFC_ENABLE_PYTHON:BOOL=OFF .
    make
    make install

For more options, it is convenient to use a CMake GUI. To use a GUI (if
installed) for an out-of-source build, simply type

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake-gui ../
    make
    make install

3. License

The header file ufc.h and UFC Python utils are released into the public domain.
