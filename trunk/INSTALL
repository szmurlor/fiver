Fiver Installation

To build and run Fiver requires libQGLViewer which can be downloaded from sites:
	- http://www.libqglviewer.com 
	- https://build.opensuse.org/package/show?package=libQGLViewer&project=home%3Arumianom
	- On Ubuntu you can install packages libqglviewer-qt4-2 & libqglviewer-dev-common via apt-get 

To build and install Fiver type the following commands:
$ qmake
$ make
$ make install

By default Fiver is installed into /usr/bin, /usr/lib and examples into /usr/share/fiver/examples.
You can specify other installation root via INSTALL_ROOT variable in the first step.
$ qmake INSTALL_ROOT=/usr/local
There exists also INSTALL_ROOT variable in the third step which is different and by default empty.

By default Fiver is linked against libqglviewer-qt4 if your installation of libQGLViewer has other name specify it via QGLVIEWER_LIB="libQGLViewer2" in the first step.
$ qmake QGLVIEWER_LIB="libQGLViewer2"

To run Fiver without installation use start script.
$ ./start
